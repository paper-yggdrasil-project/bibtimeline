  abstract = "This article describes TEAM, a transportable natural-language interface system. TEAM was constructed to test  the feasibility of building a natural-language system that could be adapted to interface with new databases by users who  are not experts in natural-language processing. An overview of the system design is presented, emphasizing those choices  that were imposed by the demands of transportability. Several general problems of natural-language processing that were   faced in constructing the system are discussed, including quantifier scoping, various pragmatic issues, and verb  acquisition. TEAM is compared with several other transportable systems; this comparison includes a discussion of the  range of natural language handled by each as well as a description of the approach taken to achieving transportability in   each system."
